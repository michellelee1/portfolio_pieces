            <p><em>My Neighbor Totoro</em> is one of my all-time favorite animated movies. I am a fan of Hayao Miyazaki’s works, but <em>My Neighbor Totora</em> was one of my first Japanese animations, and I was hooked. The story is whimsical and sweet, featuring a warm, loving family and adorable characters. Despite the magical, fun setting, the story has a dash of sadness as it takes place in a post war period and adds some real family drama. The bittersweet emotions elevate the quality of this movie because it caters to a wide audience in both adult and children of all ages.</p>

            <p>I watched another film that was produced by Studio Ghibli, but under another director, Isao Takahata. It was called <em>Grave of the Fireflies</em>. This is the saddest, heart-breaking movie ever! I cried from the beginning all the way to the end. It’s about two orphaned siblings and their struggle to survive a war ravaged Japan. It is the complete opposite of <em>My Neighbor Totora</em>. Both movies are terrific; however, I preferred a light, whimsical story with a happy ending over a heart wrenching drama.</p>
