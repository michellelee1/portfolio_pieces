        <h2>Women of the World's Fair</h2>

        <h3>The Woman's Building</h3>
        <ul>Main Purpose
            <li>Locate women in the modern world</li>
            <li>Commented as one of the most innovative aspects of the exposition</li>
            <li>Dedicated to an entire exhibit to the achievement of the so-called fairer sex</li>
            <li>Highly conscious to display women’s contribution to fine and applied arts, education, family life, service, and other fields in which women had labored.</li>
            <li>Filled with the evidence of women’s contributions to industrial innovation to technology</li>
        </ul>
        
        <ul>Controversy
            <li>African American women requested to be a part of the representation in the fair, but the BLM denied their request. They did not see the discrimination in the denial</li>
            <li>The exhibits only included some works by African America women</li>
            <li>A battle over whether or not the women’s building should be all about demanding more political rights for women, especially in terms of the public sphere, or whether or not it should be merely a celebration of women’s status as it was at the moment in the United States.</li>
            <li>The Midway Plaissance, or "Pleasure Way", displayed women in a different light. The Temple of Beauty was the highlight of the Algerian village. Exotic beauties from forieng lands performed the danse du ventre, better known as a the "hoochie coochie" dance or a strip tease. Little Egypt was the featured dancer, exotic and beautiful.</li>
            <li>The ironic face is in the location of the Temple of Beauty to the Women’s Building on the fairground. From the rooftop, there was a clear view to the Temple of Beauty in the Algerian Village, where they see salacious women luring men into cheap entertainment.</li>
